# DEU_Game
I made a C# program for a simple DEU game. There are two players. The aim of the game is to make the "D-E-U" sequence (straight or reverse) among connected squares (horizontally or vertically or diagonally). At each turn of the game, the program randomly inserts one of the three leters “D”, “E” or “U” to any array for a player.
